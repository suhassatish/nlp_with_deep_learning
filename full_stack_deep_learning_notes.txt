Find High impact, high  feasibility (low cost) projects in industry: mental models
    1) cheap prediction
    2) automate complex SW pipelines
    3) eg - rules-based model tuning can be automated using ML
    4) what are accuracy requirements? (reco engine 60% is good enough)
    5) how costly are wrong predictions?

----------
Choosing a metric -
    1) Combine metrics to optimize a single number
    2) Formula will and can change

----------
Choosing baseline for lower bound on performance
----------

Day 2 -
Debugging DL models -
Start with simplest model, add complexity later.

Sensible default for adam optz learning rate is 3e-4

activations - relu( FC and conv models), tanh for LSTMs

Init: normal (relu), glorot normal (tanh).

regularization: initially none. Makes it hard to debug.

data normalization: none.

Normalize scale fo input data by subtracting mean and dividing by std dev

---
start with small data set -
10K images for training, 1k for validation, 500 for test.
